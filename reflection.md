What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I really like unit testing because I usually use a main to test my code, but the unit test is more organized and less cluttered. I picked up the syntax quickish so that was a good feeling. I know there are errors with my original train code, so I feel like I was writing the test to fit what i've already written vs what I actually want the code to do. In the future I think this will be more useful since I'll be writing tests alongside my code. I tried to write a before class because for every test I made a new train, and it would be so much eaiser if I didn't need to do that, but I figured since I could not immediatly figure it out I would be best to write it without the before class and learn it later. I don't think my last two test classes are actually testing the right things. I really struggled to figure out how to make sure the manifest interate correctly. I easily tested that when making the method because I could see the print statement. With the JUnit, I'm really not sure. To someone doing this assignment in the future, I would try to fix your original train code first and then write the tests.
